<p>Professor Aaron Ciechanover is Distinguished Research Professor in the
Faculty of Medicine at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. He completed
his MSc and MD at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and a doctorate in
biological sciences at Technion. His collaboration with Avram Hershko and
Irwin A. Rose led to the discovery that the covalent attachment of ubiquitin
to a target protein signals it for degradation. They deciphered the mechanism
of conjugation, described the general proteolytic functions of the system,
and proposed a model according to which this modification serves as a recognition
signal for a specific downstream protease. For their findings, they were
jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2004.</p>

<p>Other accolades that Prof Ciechanover has received include the 2000 Albert
Lasker Award, the 2006 Sir Hans Krebs Medal and the 2011 Humboldt Research
Award. He is also a member of the Israeli National Academy of Sciences
and Humanities, the US National Academies of Sciences and of Medicine (Foreign
Associate), the Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican, and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Foreign Member).</p>
