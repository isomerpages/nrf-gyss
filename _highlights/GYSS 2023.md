<b>We also had insightful plenaries by the eminent scientists. third of the world’s GDP and supports life as we know it. In his plenary lecture, Sir David MacMillan described how his laboratory developed a catalysis process using only organic molecules, which he named asymmetric organocatalysis. For him, this sustainable, affordable, and accessible form of catalysis opens opportunities for researchers across the globe to help build our future using nature’s abundant and renewable resources.</b>

<b>A key focus of the GYSS is to nurture the next generation of scientists and one of the ways it does so is to provide opportunities for aspiring researchers to present their work to eminent scientists and like-minded fellows - physically or virtually. Here, a young scientist shares more about her work in microbiology, focusing on the microbial ecosystem in the atmosphere.</b>
