<p><em>Over five days, 342 young researchers came together at the Global Young Scientists Summit 2025 in Singapore to hear from distinguished speakers and build lasting connections.</em>
</p>
<p>At the 13<sup>th</sup> iteration of the Global Young Scientists Summit
(GYSS), organised by the National Research Foundation (NRF), conversations
on collaboration and common global challenges came to the fore.</p>
<p>From Jan 6 to 10, young researchers had the opportunity to visit state-of-the-art
research facilities in Singapore, hear from 18 distinguished speakers in
panels and plenary lectures and have their burning questions answered at
small-group fireside chats. The speakers and eminent scientists in attendance
included Fields Medal, Millennium Technology Prize and Nobel Prize winners.</p>

<p>While the summit regularly encourages connection and collaboration, this
year, speakers additionally emphasised the global challenges that unite
us and must be solved together. In his opening remarks, former Deputy Prime
Minister and Chairman of the NRF, Mr Heng Swee Keat, shared his hope that
the GYSS will stimulate and inspire a new generation of exceptional scientists.</p>
<p>“Big complex problems are difficult to work out. By bringing together
more of our best minds [and] sharing a common purpose of tackling these
challenges, we better our chances of success,” he said.</p>

<p>The festivities began on Jan 6 with participants visiting several local
universities including the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National
University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU) and
Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). They were also hosted
at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s (A*STAR) Food Innovation
Tech Centre as well as NRF’s Campus for Research Excellence and Technological
Enterprise (CREATE).</p>
<p>Back at NUS, where the remaining days of the summit were held, the young
researchers gathered to engage in panel huddles, plenary lectures and fireside
chats with the distinguished speakers. Several scientists also had the
opportunity to present their work in quickfire pitches.</p>

<p>True to the defining topic of the event, the first panel, <em>Interdisciplinary approaches to solving global challenges</em>,
saw Professor Dame Sue Black, Professor Takaaki Kajita and Professor Wendelin
Werner sharing their experiences working with collaborators from different
fields and encouraging participants to cross the boundaries of their disciplines.</p>
<p>“At the threshold, you step from one world into another,” said Prof Dame
Sue. “The threshold is where the excitement is: when an anatomist meets
a physicist or a mathematician, where something another scientist says
sets your mind off because you’ve never thought that way before.”</p>

<p>In his plenary lecture, after sharing his journey to the discovery of
introns and gene-splicing, Professor Sir Richard Roberts echoed this sentiment.
“It’s worth remembering that grouping together is a good thing no matter
what you’re doing,” he advised.</p>

<p>Looking ahead towards an extremely prevalent topic for the future of research,
at the final panel huddle, Professor Yael Kalai, Professor Joan Rose and
Professor Adi Shamir discussed the <em>Ethics of Scientific Research in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). </em>Young
researchers are consistently wrestling with rapidly advancing technologies
and methods—the rise of AI is no different. The panellists covered concerns
like bias in data representation and offered their thoughts on the direction
of existing government regulation.</p>
