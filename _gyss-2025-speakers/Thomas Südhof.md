<p>Professor Thomas C. Südhof is a neuroscientist whose work has described
how neurons communicate with each other at synapses and how such communication
becomes impaired in neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. He obtained
his MD and doctoral degrees from the University of Göttingen, Germany and
trained as a postdoctoral fellow at UT Southwestern in Dallas, Texas. He
currently holds the position of Avram Goldstein Professor at the Stanford
University School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Südhof is known particularly for the discovery of how synapses rapidly
release neurotransmitters and how neurons form synapses via engagement
of trans-synaptic adhesion molecules. His research earned him the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine and the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research
Award in 2013. Currently, his studies centre on the question of how synapses
in the brain are formed and how their properties are shaped, resulting
in the identification of trans-neuronal signalling mechanisms that control
synaptic connections.</p>
