<p>Professor Hartmut Michel has been a director at the Max Planck Institute
of Biophysics in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, since 1987. He studied biochemistry
in Tübingen and Munich, and received his PhD from the University of Würzburg
in 1977 for work in bioenergetics. He is a member or foreign member of
many learned societies, including the Leopoldina (German National Academy
of Science), the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the US National Academy of
Sciences and the Royal Society (London).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1988, Prof Michel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, together
with Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber, “for the determination of the
three-dimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction centre”. He has
since expanded his work onto other membrane proteins, often of medical
importance. He has been most successful with secondary active transporters,
which are membrane-integrated proteins that enable the specific transport
of substances like nutrients and building blocks across biological membranes.</p>
