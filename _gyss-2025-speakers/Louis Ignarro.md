<p>Professor Louis J. Ignarro has devoted his life’s work to advancing heart
health. He is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Molecular and Medical
Pharmacology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where
he has excelled as both a research scientist and a professor since 1985,
winning many Golden Apple teaching awards from his medical students. He
began his basic research into nitric oxide and its relationship with the
cyclic nucleotide cGMP during his tenure at the Tulane University School
of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1998, Prof Ignarro was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,
along with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad, “for their discovery that
nitric oxide acts as a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system”.
His numerous discoveries on the role of nitric oxide have led to significant
advancements in cardiovascular science and the understanding of heart disease.
He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society and is a member of the US
National Academies of Sciences and of Medicine, the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.</p>
