<p>Professor F. Duncan M. Haldane is the Sherman Fairchild University Professor
of Physics at Princeton University, a Fellow of the Royal Society (London),
and an International Member of the US National Academy of Sciences and
the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He received his PhD in theoretical
condensed matter physics from Cambridge University.</p>
<p>For his theoretical work on topological states of matter, including pioneering
work on unexpected (and initially controversial) topological quantum states
of one-dimensional systems of magnetic atoms, Prof Haldane was awarded
a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016. He is also the recipient
of the 1993 Oliver Buckley Prize and the 2012 Dirac Medal. His work has
opened up new directions and ways of thinking about quantum effects in
condensed matter and also initiated the field of topological photonics.
He currently works on quantum geometry in the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>
