<p>Professor Wendelin Werner is a French and German mathematician whose work
is driven by a curiosity to unravel the abstract ideas of the world around
us. He is currently Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics and Royal Society
Research Professor at the University of Cambridge. He held professorships
at Paris-Sud University (now Paris-Saclay University) from 1997 to 2013
and at ETH Zürich from 2013 to 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His research in probability theory and related topics have earned him
awards, including the 2001 Fermat Prize, the 2005 Loève Prize, the 2006
SIAM George Pólya Prize and the 2016 Heinz Gumin Prize for Mathematics.
He received the 2006 Fields Medal “for his contributions to the development
of stochastic Loewner evolution, the geometry of two-dimensional Brownian
motion and conformal field theory.” He is a member of the French Academy
of Sciences, the Leopoldina (German National Academy of Sciences) and the
Royal Society (London).</p>
