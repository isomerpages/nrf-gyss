<p>The Global Young Scientists Summit 2026 brings together a new generation
of scientific talent and distinguished global leaders, continuing the theme
“Excite, Engage, Enable” to create a vibrant platform for fresh ideas,
candid conversations and collaborations that can shape the future of science
and innovation.</p>
<p>Over five days, nominated participants can look forward to a dynamic programme
of plenary lectures, panel huddles, fireside chats, quickfire pitches,
poster sessions and site visits (to Singapore’s leading research and innovation
institutions), creating touchpoints for meaningful dialogue, mentorship
and new partnerships.</p>
