<p>How can we make STEM more inclusive and provide equitable opportunities
across the various fields of study? In this thought-provoking panel, five
distinguished leaders from diverse scientific and engineering disciplines
will share their unique experiences and challenges they have faced in their
careers, while delving into strategies that will even the playing field
for future generations of scientists.</p>

<p>In a world where scientific influence becomes increasingly distributed,
the call for collaborative science and shared innovation is louder than
ever. This discourse will examine the convergence of science, genomics,
and geopolitics amid rising complexity and competition, asking the question:
where trade diplomacy fails, will science diplomacy thrive?</p>

<h4><strong>8 JANUARY</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Supercomputing and Quantum: Redefining the Future</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Panellists: </strong>Prof Adi Shamir, Prof Jack Dongarra, Prof
Kae Nemoto, Dr Patricia Lee, Prof Torsten Hoefler
<br><strong>Moderator:</strong> Prof Tulika Mitra</p>
<p>In this lively discussion, our panellists will debate the strengths, limitations,
and potential convergence of mainstream supercomputing and quantum technology
into what is known as hybrid computing. With quantum technology still in
its infancy stage, how would the future of computing be defined, and what
impact will it have across industries — from materials science to medicine?</p>

<h4><strong>9 JANUARY</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains &amp; Bytes: Levelling Up Research in the Age of GenAI</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Panellists: </strong>Sir David Klenerman, Sir Konstantin Novoselov,
Dr Patricia Lee, Sir Tim Hunt
<br><strong>Moderator:</strong> Prof Simon Chesterman</p>
<p>Opinions on Generative AI (GenAI) are divisive, but the impact it has
had on how we think, create, and collaborate is undeniable. This panel
will explore how researchers can leverage AI to amplify discovery and productivity,
while upholding scientific integrity, originality, and ethical responsibility.
In an era fast becoming defined by algorithms, balancing human intellect
("brains") with machine intelligence ("bytes") is necessary to ensure responsible
AI use.</p>
