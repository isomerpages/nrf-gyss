This year, over 350 participants from about 35 countries will attend the Global Young Scientists Summit (GYSS).  Invited Nobel laureates will convene in Singapore and share about how their discoveries which occurred in humble laboratories, have over time led to the betterment of our world. Truly an inspiration to youths interested in science and technology, as well as scientists and researchers who have anchored their work in Asia.

Science and technology are the stabilizers in a world that is in flux. We have in one generation experienced a pandemic, global economic shifts, and technological disruptions. New solutions are required to solve evolving challenges in the future. At the GYSS, young scientists will be able to connect with established researchers, innovators, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists within our Science and Technology ecosystem. By working together, new opportunities can be explored for the translation of research into solutions.

This year, there will be 16 esteemed speakers, of which six will be speaking at the GYSS for the first time. About 16 young scientists will helm plenaries and discussions, as well as presentations and sharing sessions of their work. There will also be fringe activities, learning journeys and discussions to excite and engage participants on new technologies, frontier research, and science exploration.

Indeed, the GYSS celebrates the inquiring mind â€“ one that thrives on curiosity, passion, and perseverance. The friendships and bonds forged will encourage our young scientists to push boundaries in research and innovation.

I wish everyone an engaging and inspiring summit ahead.<br>
