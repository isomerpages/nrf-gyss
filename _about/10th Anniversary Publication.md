Over the past decade, nearly 4,000 scientists and researchers from over 40 countries have attended the Global Young Scientists Summit (GYSS).

Many bright-eyed participants who were at the start of their careers have become trailblazers in their fields, doing their part to create a better future for the world.

With a decade of the GYSS to celebrate, the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF), which organises the annual event, marked the occasion by launching this commemorative publication titled “Where Great Minds Meet: 10 Years of the Global Young Scientists Summit.”

Some of the Summit’s 88 distinguished speakers and the young researchers who attended the Summit shared their experiences of being part of its growth in the publication.

Learn more about the Summit and its efforts in ushering the next generation researchers and scientists through the 10th anniversary publication below.
