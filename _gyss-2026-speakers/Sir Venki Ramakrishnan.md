<p>Sir Venkatraman ‘Venki’ Ramakrishnan is a Nobel Prize-winning biologist
whose many scientific contributions include his work on the atomic structure
of the ribosome. As the site within living cells where the genetic information
is read to synthesise proteins from amino acids, improved understanding
of the ribosome has yielded many fundamental biological insights.</p>
<p>He determined the atomic structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit followed
by structures of the entire ribosome in many different states and in complexes
with several antibiotics. More recently, he has been using electron microscopy
to visualise ribosomes in action in higher organisms. This work has advanced
our understanding of how the ribosome works and how antibiotics inhibit
it. In the past, he also worked on histone and chromatin structure, which
helped us to understand how DNA is organised in cells.</p>
<p>Sir Venki received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on ribosomal
structure and was knighted in 2012. He is a Member of the US National Academy
of Sciences, Leopoldina, and EMBO, and a Foreign Member of the Indian National
Science Academy. He was President of the Royal Society from November 2015
until November 2020.</p>
