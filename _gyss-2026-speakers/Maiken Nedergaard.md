<p>Professor Maiken Nedergaard, MD, DMSc, is a Danish neuroscientist best
known for discovering the glymphatic system, the brain’s unique waste clearance
pathway. She earned her medical and doctoral degrees at the University
of Copenhagen before moving to the United States for research training.
Her early work demonstrated that astrocytes—electrically silent cells—are
active participants in neural processing. In 2012, her group first described
the glymphatic system, transforming our understanding of fluid dynamics
and waste clearance in the brain. Her research has since shown that glymphatic
activity is closely tied to sleep and is impaired in ageing and neurological
diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Nedergaard holds professorships at the University of Copenhagen’s
Center for Translational Neuromedicine and at the University of Rochester
Medical Center. She has authored landmark papers in leading journals, including <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>,
and <em>Cel</em>l. Her discoveries have led to multiple patents and collaborations
with industry to develop new therapies for neurological disorders. Today,
she continues to lead international, multidisciplinary teams focused on
brain clearance, neurovascular biology, and translational neuroscience.</p>
