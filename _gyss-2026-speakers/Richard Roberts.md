<p>Sir Richard J. Roberts is Chief Scientific Officer at New England Biolabs
in Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States. He first joined the company as
chief consultant in 1975 and later moved there permanently in 1992. He
received his PhD in Organic Chemistry in 1968 from Sheffield University
and was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.</p>
<p>While at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory from 1972 to 1992, he began work
on the newly discovered Type II restriction enzymes. His laboratory discovered
more than 70 percent of the first 100 enzymes described. Studies of transcription
in Adenovirus-2 led to the discovery of split genes and mRNA splicing in
1977, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in
1993. Since then, Sir Richard has been involved in organising a number
of Nobel initiatives to correct scientific misunderstandings and promote
humanitarian causes, such as supporting the use of genetically modified
organism techniques to improve plant breeding practices.</p>
