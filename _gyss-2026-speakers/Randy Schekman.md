<p>Randy Schekman is a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell
Biology, University of California, Berkeley, and an Investigator at the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He studied the enzymology of DNA replication
as a graduate student with Arthur Kornberg at Stanford University. His
current interest in cellular membranes developed during a postdoctoral
period with S. J. Singer at the University of California San Diego.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among his awards are the Gairdner International Award, the Albert Lasker
Award in Basic Medical Research and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,
which he shared with James Rothman and Thomas Südhof. He served as the
Editor of the <em>Annual Reviews of Cell and Developmental Biology</em> and
as Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em> and <em>eLife</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in 2018, Prof Schekman serves as the Scientific Director of
Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s Disease, a major philanthropic effort
organised along with The Michael J. Fox Foundation to identify molecular
and cellular mechanisms in the initiation and progression of Parkinson’s
Disease. Prof Schekman’s laboratory investigates the mechanism of vesicular
traffic in the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells. Currently, the lab
focuses on the unconventional secretion of extracellular vesicles and of
soluble proteins, such as alpha-synuclein. The means by which alpha-synuclein
is released by nerve cells may relate to the spread of pathology in Parkinson’s
Disease.</p>
