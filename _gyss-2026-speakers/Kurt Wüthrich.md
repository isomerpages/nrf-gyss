<p>Kurt Wüthrich is the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Professor of Structural
Biology at Scripps Research in the United States, Professor of Biophysics
at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, and Distinguished Senior Professor at the
iHuman Institute, ShanghaiTech University in China. For 50 years, Prof
Wüthrich’s groups at these three institutions have used nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR) for research in structural biology. Their
contributions include developing the method of protein structure determination
with NMR in solution, and the use of the principles of transverse relaxation-optimized
spectroscopy (TROSY) for NMR experiments with large supramolecular assemblies.
Their applications over the years were focused on differentiation in higher
organisms, immune suppression, and neuropathology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since April 2019, Prof Wüthrich has continued his research using NMR techniques
at ShanghaiTech University, with a focus on transmembrane signal transfer
by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). At Scripps Research and ETH Zürich,
projects on the general theme “healthcare in the ageing human societies
of the 21st century” are pursued, mainly considering the impact of sarcopenia
on the human healthspan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Wüthrich’s achievements have been recognised by a number of awards
and honorary degrees, including the Prix Louis Jeantet de Médecine, the
Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
