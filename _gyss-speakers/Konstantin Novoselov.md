<p>In 2004, Sir Konstantin successfully isolated graphene, the first known
2D material, and mapped its unique properties together with Professor Sir
Andre Geim. Their discovery paved the way for experiments on other 2D atomic
crystals with superior and versatile properties to potentially create new
materials with a wide range of applications. In recognition of their groundbreaking
work, they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. Sir
Konstantin is also formally educated in and maintains an active interest
in modern Chinese art, where he uses novel approaches and materials, the
most notable of which is the introduction of graphene ink.</p>
