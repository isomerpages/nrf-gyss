title: Global Young Scientists Summit
description: The Global Young Scientists Summit in Singapore brings together
  bright young researchers and top scientific minds from around the world to
  discuss science and technology trends, future game changers and how research
  could address major global challenges. Organised by the National Research
  Foundation, Singapore (NRF), it was started in 2013 with the objective of
  exciting and engaging young scientists to pursue their scientific dreams
  through close interactions with distinguished scientists and researchers, and
  with peers. The Summit provides a platform for conversations on science and
  research, technology innovation and society, and solutions to global
  challenges.
