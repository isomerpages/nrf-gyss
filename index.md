  bright young researchers and top scientific minds from around the world to
  discuss science and technology trends, future game changers and how research
  could address major global challenges. Organised by the National Research

  with peers. The Summit provides a platform for conversations on science and
  research, technology innovation and society, and solutions to global
  challenges.
