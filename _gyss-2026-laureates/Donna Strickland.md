<p>Donna Strickland is a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy
at the University of Waterloo. In 2018, she received the Nobel Prize in
Physics, together with her then PhD supervisor Gérard Mourou, for developing
chirped pulse amplification. They published this Nobel-winning research
in 1985 when Prof Strickland was a PhD student at the University of Rochester
in New York. Together, they paved the way towards the most intense laser
pulses ever created.</p>
<p>Prof Strickland was a research associate at the National Research Council
Canada, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a member
of technical staff at Princeton University. In 1997, she joined the University
of Waterloo, where her ultrafast laser group develops high-intensity laser
systems for nonlinear optics investigations. She was named a Companion
of the Order of Canada, and is also a recipient of a Sloan Research Fellowship,
a Premier’s Research Excellence Award and a Cottrell Scholar Award.</p>
<p>Prof Strickland served as the president of the Optical Society (OSA) in
2013. She is a fellow of OSA and SPIE, the Royal Society of Canada and
the Royal Society. She is also an honorary fellow of the Canadian Academy
of Engineering as well as the Institute of Physics, and an international
member of the US National Academy of Science. She earned a PhD in optics
from the University of Rochester and a B.Eng. from McMaster University.</p>
